Numerical solution of Poisson's equation using C++ and Matlab:

The objective of this project is to develop a program using C++ to solve Poisson's equation for different structures composed by small square objects.

The structure is formed by a 100mm*160mm ground plane and second layer of defined layout, forming a capacitor with the ground plane. The capacitance of the overall structures has to be calculated for the following distances between ground plane and second layer: 5mm, 10mm, 15mm, 20mm and 25mm.

I used following methods:
CreateStructure()
CreateMatrix()
CreateExcitationVector()
FindChargeDistribution()
CalculateTotalCharge()
